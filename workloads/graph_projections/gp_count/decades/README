Readme for the makefile to conduct a pre-automated compilation and run of graph projections on MosaicSim simulator

The script conducts 2 runs each (1 thread, 2 threads) for non-decoupled and decoupled supply/compute, using default config file (in order core)

Output files for runs are in sim_output/base_nthreads and sim_output/decoupled_nthreads, where n is 1 or 2
Most relevant stats are under "GLOBAL STATS" at the bottom of the files

To compile and run, simply type make
