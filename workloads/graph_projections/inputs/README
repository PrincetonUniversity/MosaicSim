# currently tested on 4 datasets from http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/

# get datasets and then run utiles/complete_flow.sh on the out.* file (FROM THE 'utils' DIRECTORY!)
# this will give you x_to_y_graph.txt and y_to_x_graph.txt.
# DECADES kernels can run on either.

# youtube dataset needs a second line comment showing number of edges, x_nodes and y_nodes

# Small

# still pretty small (probably the one to simulate on?)

# medium (simulate on this one if you feel brave!)

# pretty big

# slightly bigger

# a bunch more if you wanna have a look at the website: these
# basically cover the range between small and large though. Anything
# else is likely too small to be interesting, or big enough to take up
# tons of memory.
