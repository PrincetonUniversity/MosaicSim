/* Issues */ (High Priority)

[Sim] TJH / Two Phase Cycle: Operation finishing on cycle n should not let its dependent to run on cycle n (same applies for contexts and context creation)
[Sim] 0-latency Inst: Handle 0 latency instructions (and context creation)
[Sim] Decouple Store Address and Store Value: Store does not have to wait for its both operand to mark it as "addr_resolved"

/* Major Functionality */
[Sim] JLA / Limited number of active, same BB contexts
[Sim] Luwa / Store to Load Forwarding 
[Sim] Chirag & Luwa / Cache Hierarchy: Integrate Cache hierarchy (provided hint code to Chirag)
[Sim] MSHR request merges : N DRAM requests to the same cacheline (in a short time) should be merged instead of issuing N separate requests for the same cacheline
[Workload] SHOC & Machsuite

/* Code Improvements */ (Low Priority)
[Sim] Probably change Dnode from <node*, int> to <node*, context*>
[Compilation] Chirag / Make a script for easy compilation and run
[GraphGen] Automatically inline all functions or make it inter-procedural
[Sim] Improve Node/Graph Print
[Sim] readGraph does not read instruction name correctly
[Sim] Handle BB entry block in a better way
[GraphGen and Sim] Handle BB to Phi dependencies in a better way

/* Note */

Initial version of workload-to-sim pipeline is ready. 

1. To compile workload, go to workloads/test and type "make"
2. in bin/, "./sim-apollo ../workloads/test/" to execute "test" workload

Chirag will spend some time on making some of these to be a one-command process

/* CHANGELOG */
