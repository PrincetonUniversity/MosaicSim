/* Major Functionality */
[GraphGen/Sim] Induction Variable optimization (remove induction variable dependency)
[Sim] JLA: Limited number of active, same BB contexts
[Sim] Luwa: Handling LSQ resource limits (I believe this is now done)
[Sim] Chirag & Luwa / Cache Hierarchy: Integrate Cache hierarchy (provided hint code to Chirag)
[Sim] MSHR request merges : N DRAM requests to the same cacheline (in a short time) should be merged instead of issuing N separate requests for the same cacheline
[Workload] Chirag & JLA / SHOC & Machsuite

/* Minor Functionality */
[Sim] Detailed resource limits for memory systems
[Sim] PHI_Node 0 latency

/* Code Improvements */ (Low Priority)
[Compilation] Chirag / Make a script for easy compilation and run
[GraphGen] Automatically inline all functions or make it inter-procedural
[Sim] Improve Node/Graph Print
[Sim] readGraph does not read instruction name correctly

/* Note */

Initial version of workload-to-sim pipeline is ready. 

1. To compile workload, go to workloads/test and type "make"
2. in bin/, "./sim ../workloads/test/" to execute "test" workload
