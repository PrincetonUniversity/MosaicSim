Here is a roadmap for all the key actions required for setting up this Example FP Multiplication tile that a core tile offloads all its FP multiplication instructions to. The tiles operate in a pair, where the core offloads computation to tile1 and tile1 offloads some computation to tile2, which finally responds to the core. 

First run the setup script with:
./setup.sh

This script replaces the "traditional" simulator files with their counterparts that reflect the changes required for this example accelerator tile. So, please do not push to github after running these tests below

Rather, type "git reset --hard HEAD" to revert back to default MosaicSim

It moves the modified code for the example tile and core to their respective folders

Source code of the example tile:
mosaic/sim/tile/ExampleTile.cc

Registering the example tile with CMAKE, for mosaic to be able to compile

line 17, mosaic/sim/CMakeLists.txt, see "tile/ExampeTile.cc" on that line

Instantiating the FP multiplication accelerator tile (contrived example tile):
line 61, mosaic/sim/main.cc
(You can play around with the tile's core frequency)

Sending FP multiplication requests to the example tile:
line 252,  mosaic/sim/tile/DynamicNode.cc

Killing the accelerator tile when the core is done:
line 259 mosaic/sim/tile/Core.cc
Here, we kill the accelerator tile, so digestor doesn't call it's process() anymore and can eventually end the simulation

Core receiving response back from example tile:
line 100, mosaic/sim/tile/Core.cc

Running it:
cd mosaic/workloads/parboil/
make
cd mosaic/bin
./sim -n 1 default ../workloads/parboil/sgemm default

It should print out real time information about what cycles transactions are being sent and received by the core
