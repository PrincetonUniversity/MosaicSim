Here is a roadmap for all the key actions required for setting up this Example FP Multiplication tile that a core tile offloads all its FP multiplication instructions to.

First run the setup script with:
./setup.sh

It moves the modified code for the example tile and core to their respective folders

Source code of the example tile:
pythia/sim/tile/ExampleTile.cc

Registering the example tile with CMAKE, for pythia to be able to compile

line 17, pythia/sim/CMakeLists.txt, see "tile/ExampeTile.cc" on that line

Instantiating the FP multiplication accelerator tile (contrived example tile):
line 61, pythia/sim/main.cc
(You can play around with the tile's core frequency)

Sending FP multiplication requests to the example tile:
line 252,  pythia/sim/tile/DynamicNode.cc

Killing the accelerator tile when the core is done:
line 259 pythia/sim/tile/Core.cc
Here, we kill the accelerator tile, so digestor doesn't call it's process() anymore and can eventually end the simulation

Core receiving response back from example tile:
line 100, pythia/sim/tile/Core.cc

Running it:
cd pythia/workloads/parboil/
make
cd pythia/bin
./sim -n 1 default ../workloads/parboil/sgemm default

It should print out real time information about what cycles transactions are being sent and received by the core
