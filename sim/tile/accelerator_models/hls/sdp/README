This implementation of the single data-point engine accelerator:

- input tensors treated as 1D arrays
- each 64-bit dma word contains two 32-bits data words
- 32-bit float operations
- not meant to be efficient for small matrices

Supports:
- element-wise tensor addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- scalar and tensor addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\
- activation functions: ReLU
