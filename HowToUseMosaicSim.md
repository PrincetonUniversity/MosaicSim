# MosaicSim
This tutorial describes how to use the compiler+simulator flow that is provided by the DECADES framework. For a simulation we need:
1. An architecture and tile configurations 
2. A program that can be compiled to be executed on this architecture.
3. Execution of the program to obtain memory and control flow trace that the simulator uses to simulate its execution on this specific architecture.

We start with the program and what are the requirements for the programmer to enable its compilation for different parallelization schemes DECADES compiler provides. We will then describe the options for how the native execution can be achieved. Then, we will describe how different architectural designs can be created as well as how new accelerator tiles can be incorporated.
